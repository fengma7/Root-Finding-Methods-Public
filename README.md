# Root Finding Methods - Python
A set of three programs that utilize the bisection, Newton-Raphson, and secant method to find a singular root from a given equation as well as other inputs that differ between each program. All three methods output either an error message that is raised if the inputs could not produce a valid output or the discovered root of the function with a table of values that displays how each method gradually obtained its root.
